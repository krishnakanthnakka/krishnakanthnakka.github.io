I'm a PhD student at CVLab, Department of Computer Science, EPFL. I'm fortunate to be supervised by [Dr. Mathieu Salzmann](https://people.epfl.ch/cgi-bin/people?id=119864&op=bio&lang=en&cvlang=en)  and Dr. Pascal Fua in the areas of computer vision, deep learning. My research focus is primarily to develop interpretable neural network architectures.


Before joining EPFL, I was employed at Samsung Research Bangalore for 2 years developing mobile camera algorithms. I graduated from Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Kharagpur in 2015 with Dual degree (MTech in Signal Processing and BTech in Electrical Engineering).


Please email me if you would like to pursue a semester project at EPFL. Please take a look at my recent projects to get an overview.
